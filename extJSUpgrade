		find my own code to test out the windows layout. http://localhost:8090/parkingUI/Desktop.jsp
		still running 2.3 and it is faster than 3.4. Not bad, and it is simpler to learn the stuff too.
		
		report had issue.
		items have reloadDataSource with nothing.  messed up closing brackets
		
		-- figure out how to add a new icon in the screen.
			files to be modified. and steps to create it.
			
			revisit this to understand the architecture
			
			create a new js in window-js
				make sure the id is identical in multiple place within the file. 
				id: kicklog-win
			
			Desktop.jsp - include the new js as part of the script, and add a link in the bottom as an icon.
				<dt id="kick-win-shortcut"><a href="#"><img src="./images/s.gif" />	
			
			sample.js - add new entry as part of myDesktop.
			css/desktop.css - add a new icon for the shortcut name or else it wouldn't work.
			
			model after applog-win.js

			matched id. but now it won't even appear. adding console.log
			It did not go to desktop.js at all.
			Changed it to quota-win-shortcut, and it works fine.  
			What did I miss? id is missing. it did not go and hit the windows. that's why.
			I called the id kicklog-win, instead of kick-win, needs to match up with the js filename and the id
	
			okay finally got it working. taking longer than I thought.
	
	
		-- Report section.   Billing by Division, or I can't get it to work.
		   More testing required. Need test cases.

			flex-report might had the same issue in terms of the id.

--------------------------------------------------
	extjs 2.3
			learn the js code, and figure out how things are done.
			compare to extJS 3.4 library. learn how something are being built.
	
			use winmerge or diff on ext-all-debug.js and ext-all-debug-w-comments.js
			There are multiple changes that I didn't realize.
