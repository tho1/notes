Powershell cmdlets that are useful to look things up.

Windows operating system comes with powershell to look things up.  It is like a Windows version of Unix shell, with its set of cmdlet. 
The great thing is it comes with windows.

Windows also had the PowerShell ISE to try out new cmdlet.  Think of like a scratchpad to try out cmdlet.

Useful one.
