It is part of the token parser, similar to the source code analyser, but skip the part on turning out the object code like a compiler.  Instead it produces the source code. Furthermore, some compiler also produce the assembly code. 

What about the tools that helps to browser source code like ctags and cscope?  They also implement some of the functionalites too.
