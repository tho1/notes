[Frontend Developments in 2020] ( https://medium.com/dailyjs/a-realworld-comparison-of-front-end-frameworks-2020-4e50655fe4c1)

Looking at framework via the rear view mirror.

UI framework had been fascinating. Due to the proliferation of the web, lots of desktop applications had been migrated to the using HTML technology plus CSS, SASS, Javascript and many technologies.  

Some of us who had been around for awhile remember the HTML pages build had the flashing text and falling snow in the background.  This reminds of <blink> html tag that had been made obsolete.  With the rise of html5 and the use of canvas tag, more interesting applications had been doable in HTML5.  

A fine example is the Winamp desktop audio player that is first release in 1997.  Doing this in a webpage back in late 1990 is not possible.  Then we have the <audio> tag that becomes available to play audio file within a browser.  And lately the github user Jordan Eldredge reimplmented the winamp look and feels using HTML5 and javascript.  See [webamp] (https://github.com/captbaritone/webamp). 


What about other UI frameworks that had been in use for a long time?
