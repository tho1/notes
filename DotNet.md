Dot Net notes.


[.Net core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/dotnet/what-is-dotnet)  is a rework of .Net version 4, with leaner libraries.
[.NET Core vs ASP.NET Core](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44136118/net-core-vs-asp-net-core)   Note: ASP.NET Core 3 and higher now depend on .NET Core and can no longer be used on .NET Framework. 


Version history of .NET
1. Version 1.0 - the initial version of ASP.NET, contemporaneously released alongside Visual Studio.NET.
2. Version 1.1 - As the next significant version, 1.1 was released alongside Windows server 2003 and Visual Studio.NET 2003. Various supplemental features were added, such as the automatic validation of input as well as important mobile controls.
3. Version 2.0 was released in tandem with Visual Web Developer Express, Visual Studio 2005 and SQL Server 2005. As a major release, it contained a plethora of additional features, such as GridView, FormView, and DetailsView data controls, alongside navigation and login controls, master pages, and a vast quantity of other additions. Notably, this version was the first to include the now crucial 64-bit processor support.
4. Version 3.0 can be accurately surmised as a major release, including the consequential addition of several highly important features, such as the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), Windows Communication Foundation(WCF), Windows Workflow Foundation (WWF) and Windows Cardspace (WC).
5. Version 3.5 came to us along with Windows Server 2008 and Visual Studio 2008. At this time, Microsoft provided several new features, of which the most salient were ListView data controls, DataPager controls, not to mention WCF support and LINQ.
6. Version 4.0 â€“ This was the version that preceded .NET 4.5. It was released in tandem with several parallel extensions. Unsurprisingly, as a major point release, many exceedingly high-utility features were introduced, such as Web Deployment, ADO.NET, Dynamic data and an innumerable list of others.
7. ASP.NET Core 2.x, 1.x - ASP.NET Core is a redesign of ASP.NET 4.x, with architectural changes that result in a leaner, more modular framework.
